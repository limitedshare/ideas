In an age of ever-closer collaboration, not only factories and agriculture but even scientific research and the pursuit of ideas demand high-density intellectual labor. This gives rise to a problem: scholarly work, which ought to be free and independently exploratory, has itself been turned into an assembly-line operation under the sway of centralized power. As a result, every researcher, engineer, and other knowledge worker finds their circumstances and prospects almost entirely dependent on that center of authority. Every system has flaws and loopholes, but when humanity’s better instincts and emotions prevail, those shortcomings can be forgiven or remedied—unfortunately, one seldom encounters a benevolent “boss.”

Especially in China, many systems remain imperfect. In academia and scientific research, individual rights often go unprotected, and in dark corners one finds countless hidden, unmentionable abuses—unchecked, bottomless, and fundamentally different from even the harshest official regulations, amounting instead to psychologically warped, malicious retaliation. Reliance on a single power center also renders communication within the same institution inefficient. People become subservient to the unpredictable whims and measures of their superiors, like servants. By nature, we tend to focus on immediate gains; if a centralized system fails to function well, individuals, concerned for their own safety and interests, grow short-sighted and neglect the long view. Even if a few can contemplate longer-term issues, in an environment where such discussion is absent, everyone else must scramble for the benefits right before them, making long-range thinking impossible.

In Chinese universities and research institutes, one might call this concentration of power a form of state capitalism. In society at large, people, driven by various forms of capital power, likewise become myopic. Technical and scientific workers, compelled by this overarching design to cultivate one narrow specialty after another, end up passive and may find themselves unable to defend their rights or reap the fruits of their labor. Meanwhile, those in control—or the centralized power center—cannot grasp the reality on the ground or look after each member’s interests; with the slightest intent, they can lead individuals into an abyss of no return. Even if someone foresees this fate, they have no choice but to jump, or are forced to abandon any hope in front of them—much like when Andy in The Shawshank Redemption begs the warden to verify a clue he received from a fellow inmate. To rebel against such a power center is tantamount to rebelling against the entire system. This is why problems in many universities and institutes rarely surface except through costly media exposés.

Perhaps most people in society today struggle. To survive under a rigid and unreasonable overarching design, they must wholly submit to capital’s interests, pursue immediate gains, and—by any means—apply their talents along this crooked path, giving rise to extortion, racketeering, and the like.

Yet those who have benefited from a fine higher education—drawing on the best resources from family and society, and equipped with various skills—can seek self-organized channels of communication to shoulder their social responsibilities and realize their own values. Whether intellectual or manual laborers, organized and connected, their collective power is obvious. But these organizations and connections are still built through centralization: in career development or in treatment, one often can only hope for a “wise emperor,” that is, a benign center.

Putting these issues aside, pursuing academic research or technology—engaging in fruitful communication, helping others in their studies, gaining recognition, even cooperating to overcome some challenge or achieve a goal—brings great satisfaction. Yet under a centralized system, it is hard to respect individual property rights in knowledge. Like land, when everyone clings to their own “ownership,” public undertakings stall and uniformity breeds inefficiency—especially in certain fields.

Here, I imagine a limited (or encrypted), peer-to-peer, self-organizing sharing model,

在这个合作日益紧密的时代，不但工厂，农业，就连科学研究，思想探索都需要高密度的智力劳动，这就带来一个问题，本该需要自由和独立探索的学术工作，也沦为工厂形式在权力中心支配之下的工作，这使得每一个科研人员，工程师等从事智力劳动者的境遇和发展都高度依赖于这个权力中心，任何制度都可能有漏洞和缺陷，但当人性和情感中好的一面起作用时，这些缺陷都可以被包容和补救，但常常是并不能遇到好的‘老板’。尤其是中国，很多制度还不那么健全，例如学术和科研的工作中，每个人的权益往往不能得到保障，阴暗的角落里会有许许多多隐秘且难以启齿的迫害，没有下限也几乎不受监督，和即便是严苛的管理也有本质的不同，是一种心理上畸形和恶意的报复。依赖于权力中心，也将导致即便同一个单位的成员之间，交流沟通也会变得低效。甚至使成屈服于领导不可捉摸的心思和度量，沦为奴仆。人们也总是趋向于考虑眼前的利益，这种中心化如果不能良好的发挥作用，则更是会使成员出于个人的安危与利益，变得短视而忽视了长远道路，即使少数人能够考虑到更长远的问题，但是在一个缺乏交流长远问题的当前，周围人都只能尽可能汲汲于眼前利益，充斥着这样的环境当中，无法考虑长远。在中国的高校院所，也许可以将这种集权中心理解为一种国家资本主义。在社会，人们也是在种种资本权力的驱使之下，变得短视。技术科研工作者在这种整体设计的驱使之下，竭力在一个一个专业领域去耕作，也会变得很被动，还有可能无法维护自己的权益和劳动果实。而资本层面或者集权中心则很难了解其中真实的情况，更不能顾及每个成员的利益，甚至稍动心思就可以将成员引入万劫不复的深坑，即便成员能够看到这种前景也没得选择只能跳进去，或者迫使成员放弃眼前看到的希望，如同肖申克电影中安迪求典狱长查自己从狱友口中得到的线索时的情景一样。因为反抗这种集权中心无异于反抗整个体系，这也是现在很多高校研究所的问题，很少能够反抗的都是通过媒体曝光出来这种难度成本都很高。可能现在整个社会大多数人都很艰难，而为了在一个僵化和不合理的整体设计之下苟活，只得完全屈从于资本利益，汲汲于眼前的利益，心思将走歪并将才智在这条歪路上发挥的无所不用其极，就如同现在的讹诈敲诈等事。

而经过优良高等教育深造，集合了个人家庭以及社会的很多优良教育资源，拥有了各种技能的人，可以寻找一种自组织的沟通途径来承担自己的社会责任并实现自身的价值。

不论是智力劳动者还是体力劳动者组织连接起来将能发挥的威力不言而喻，但是这些组织和连接都是通过中心化实现的，不论是工作发展还是被对待的方式，在很多情况下只能巴望一个好皇帝，即中心。况且抛开这些问题不谈，搞学术研究或者什么技术，能够合理沟通，帮助到其他人的研究或学习，被人认可，甚至于相互合作着去实现一个什么样的目标或者难关，都是极大的满足。

对于知识劳动，在一个中心化的体制里面，很难尊重个体的产权，固然，就像是土地一样，每个人都把持着自己的产权势必造成公共事业的难以开展，或者说一致性导致低效率。
这里设想一种有限（或加密）点对点自组织分享模式，
